# 📈 Breast Cancer Detection with Deep Learning

This project aims to develop a deep learning model to identify breast cancer using screening mammograms. The project dataset is obtained from the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) and contains radiographic breast images of female subjects.

## 🚀 Project Team
- Fernando Kurike Matsumoto
- José Lucas De Melo Costa
- Victor Felipe Domingues do Amaral

## 💡 Motivation

Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer worldwide, and early detection and treatment are critical to reducing cancer fatalities. Automating the detection of breast cancer in screening mammography can help improve the quality and safety of patient care, reduce costs, and unnecessary medical procedures.

## 🎯 Goals
- Train a deep learning model to detect breast cancer in screening mammograms.
- Use computer vision techniques and data augmentation methods to improve model performance.
- Participate in the RSNA Breast Cancer Detection Kaggle competition.


## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains DICOM format radiographic breast images of female subjects, with features such as age, breast density, and cancer status.
